# House Price Prediction Models
This repository contains notebooks for two machine learning models created as a part of an ML internship by Prodigy Infotech. The models are developed to predict house prices using different algorithms: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression.
## Random Forest Model
The Random Forest model notebook (model_randomforest.ipynb) utilizes a Random Forest Regression algorithm for predicting house prices. The performance metrics for this model are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Mean Absolute Error: 17904.80047075451</li>
        <li>Mean Squared Error: 721745931.3418473</li>
        <li>R-squared: 0.8965697572907512</li>
    </ul>
This model achieves higher accuracy.
## Linear Regression Model
The Linear Regression model notebook (model_lr.ipynb) implements a simple linear regression algorithm to predict house prices. The performance metrics for this model are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Mean Absolute Error: 24706.761973709345</li>
        <li>Mean Squared Error: 1357994355.927841</li>
        <li>R-squared: 0.8053917871483223</li>
    </ul>
This model achieves a moderate level of accuracy.
